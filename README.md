Please note that some configuration is Window-based.
Recently I switch to window because ...
First, I got a corporate job.
Second, I have to do drawing and graphic more often and I don't want to switch between boot.
Third, I learn to live with cmd.exe and Powershell it is more usable with package manager like Chocolatey.

# Getting start
Download `_vimrc` file and paste it at your home directory `C:\Users\your_username\`
There are two version of them
1. Plugin free version. This works out of the box
2. Version with plugin. This will provide more IDE like functionality but requires Vundle as a package manager to fetch all package.
